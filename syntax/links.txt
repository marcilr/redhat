How do I get the size of a directory on the command line?
du is your friend.  If you just want to know the total size
of a directory then jump into it and run:
  du -hs
If you also would like to know which sub-folders take up how
much disk space?! You could extend this command to:
  du -h --max-depth=1 | sort -hr
