du is your friend.  If you just want to know the total size
of a directory then jump into it and run:

  du -hs

If you also would like to know which sub-folders take up how
much disk space?! You could extend this command to:

  du -h --max-depth=1 | sort -hr

which will give you the size of all sub-folders (level 1).
The output will be sorted (largest folder on top).
