"Red Hat Software Collections (RHSCL) is intended to give
Red Hat Enterprise Linux customers the latest stable
versions of dynamic languages and open source databases
for users to create modern applications that can be
confidently deployed into production.  These fast-moving
collections are expected to be updated frequently and
will have a shorter life cycle and support term than
Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

Software Collections is available for Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 7 and previous supported releases.  Starting with
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, the content traditionally
consumed via Software Collections is now part of
Application Streams."
